## Introduction

This is a sample server Petstore server.  You can find out more about Swagger at [http://swagger.io](http://swagger.io) or on [irc.freenode.net, #swagger](http://swagger.io/irc/).  For this sample, you can use the api key `special-key` to test the authorization filters.

## Building

The generated code depends on a few Ruby gems. The references to these gems are added in the gemspec file. The easiest way to resolve the dependencies, build the gem and install it is through Rake:

1. Install Rake if not already installed: `gem install rake`
2. Install Bundler if not already installed: `gem install bundler`
3. From terminal/cmd navigate to the root directory of the SDK.
4. Invoke: `rake install`

Alternatively, you can build and install the gem manually:

1. From terminal/cmd navigate to the root directory of the SDK.
2. Run the build command: `gem build swagger_petstore.gemspec`
3. Run the install command: `gem install swagger_petstore-1.0.6.gem`

## Installation

The following section explains how to use the swagger_petstore ruby gem in a new Rails project using RubyMine&trade;. The basic workflow presented here is also applicable if you prefer using a different editor or IDE.

### 1. Starting a new project

Close any existing projects in RubyMine&trade; by selecting `File -> Close Project`. Next, click on `Create New Project` to create a new project from scratch.

![Create a new project in RubyMine - Step 1](https://apidocs.io/illustration/ruby?workspaceFolder=SwaggerPetstore&step=createNewProject0)

Next, provide `TestApp` as the project name, choose `Rails Application` as the project type, and click `OK`.

![Create a new Rails Application in RubyMine - Step 2](https://apidocs.io/illustration/ruby?workspaceFolder=SwaggerPetstore&step=createNewProject1)

In the next dialog make sure that the correct Ruby SDK is being used (>= 2.6 and <= 3.2) and click `OK`.

### 2. Add reference of the gem

In order to use the Tester gem in the new project we must add a gem reference. Locate the `Gemfile` in the Project Explorer window under the `TestApp` project node. The file contains references to all gems being used in the project. Here, add the reference to the library gem by adding the following line: `gem 'swagger_petstore', '1.0.6'`

![Add new reference to the Gemfile](https://apidocs.io/illustration/ruby?workspaceFolder=SwaggerPetstore&gemVer=1.0.6&gemName=swagger_petstore&step=addReference)

### 3. Adding a new Rails Controller

Once the `TestApp` project is created, a folder named `controllers` will be visible in the *Project Explorer* under the following path: `TestApp > app > controllers`. Right click on this folder and select `New -> Run Rails Generator...`.

![Run Rails Generator on Controllers Folder](https://apidocs.io/illustration/ruby?workspaceFolder=SwaggerPetstore&gemVer=1.0.6&gemName=swagger_petstore&step=addCode0)

Selecting the said option will popup a small window where the generator names are displayed. Here, select the `controller` template.

![Create a new Controller](https://apidocs.io/illustration/ruby?workspaceFolder=SwaggerPetstore&step=addCode1)

Next, a popup window will ask you for a Controller name and included Actions. For controller name provide `Hello` and include an action named `Index` and click `OK`.

![Add a new Controller](https://apidocs.io/illustration/ruby?workspaceFolder=SwaggerPetstore&gemVer=1.0.6&gemName=swagger_petstore&step=addCode2)

A new controller class named `HelloController` will be created in a file named `hello_controller.rb` containing a method named `Index`. In this method, add code for initialization and a sample for its usage.

## Initialize the API Client

**_Note:_** Documentation for the client can be found [here.](doc/client.md)

The following parameters are configurable for the API Client:

| Parameter | Type | Description |
|  --- | --- | --- |
| `environment` | Environment | The API environment. <br> **Default: `Environment.PRODUCTION`** |
| `connection` | `Faraday::Connection` | The Faraday connection object passed by the SDK user for making requests |
| `adapter` | `Faraday::Adapter` | The Faraday adapter object passed by the SDK user for performing http requests |
| `timeout` | `Float` | The value to use for connection timeout. <br> **Default: 60** |
| `max_retries` | `Integer` | The number of times to retry an endpoint call if it fails. <br> **Default: 0** |
| `retry_interval` | `Float` | Pause in seconds between retries. <br> **Default: 1** |
| `backoff_factor` | `Float` | The amount to multiply each successive retry's interval amount by in order to provide backoff. <br> **Default: 2** |
| `retry_statuses` | `Array` | A list of HTTP statuses to retry. <br> **Default: [408, 413, 429, 500, 502, 503, 504, 521, 522, 524]** |
| `retry_methods` | `Array` | A list of HTTP methods to retry. <br> **Default: %i[get put]** |
| `http_callback` | `HttpCallBack` | The Http CallBack allows defining callables for pre and post API calls. |
| `o_auth_client_id` | `String` | OAuth 2 Client ID |
| `o_auth_redirect_uri` | `String` | OAuth 2 Redirection endpoint or Callback Uri |
| `o_auth_token` | `OAuthToken` | Object for storing information about the OAuth token |
| `o_auth_scopes` | `OAuthScopeEnum` |  |

The API client can be initialized as follows:

```ruby
client = SwaggerPetstore::Client.new(
  o_auth_client_id: 'OAuthClientId',
  o_auth_redirect_uri: 'OAuthRedirectUri',
  o_auth_scopes: [
    OAuthScopeEnum::READPETS,
    OAuthScopeEnum::WRITEPETS
  ],
  environment: Environment::PRODUCTION
)
```

## Authorization

This API uses `OAuth 2 Implicit Grant`.

## Implicit Grant

Your application must obtain user authorization before it can execute an endpoint call incase this SDK chooses to use *OAuth 2.0 Implicit Grant* to obtain a user's consent to perform an API request on user's behalf. This authorization includes the following steps

This process requires the presence of a client-side JavaScript code on the redirect URI page to receive the *access token* after the consent step is completed.

### 1\. Obtain user consent

To obtain user's consent, you must redirect the user to the authorization page. The `get_authorization_url()` method creates the URL to the authorization page. You must have initialized the client with scopes for which you need permission to access.

```ruby
auth_url = client.auth.get_authorization_url
```

### 2\. Handle the OAuth server response

Once the user responds to the consent request, the OAuth 2.0 server responds to your application's access request by redirecting the user to the redirect URI specified set in `Configuration`.

The redirect URI will receive the *access token* as the `token` argument in the URL fragment.

```
https://example.com/oauth/callback#token=XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX
```

The access token must be extracted by the client-side JavaScript code. The access token can be used to authorize any further endpoint calls by the JavaScript code.

### Scopes

Scopes enable your application to only request access to the resources it needs while enabling users to control the amount of access they grant to your application. Available scopes are defined in the `OAuthScopeEnum` enumeration.

| Scope Name | Description |
|  --- | --- |
| `READPETS` | read your pets |
| `WRITEPETS` | modify pets in your account |
